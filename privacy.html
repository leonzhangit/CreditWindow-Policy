  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: January 2026</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Credit Window does not collect, track, or share your personal data. Data you enter (e.g., card name, balance, limits, statement day, APR) is stored locally on your device and used only for on-device calculations.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Credit Window</strong> (the “App”) handles information when you use it.
    If you have questions, contact us at <strong>root.firepower@icloud.com</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect personal data.</strong> Credit Window does not collect, transmit, or store personal information on external servers.</p>

  <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
  <p>
    The App allows you to enter credit card-related information (for example: card nickname, credit limit, current balance, statement day, and optional APR).
    This information is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and is used only to perform features such as utilization and payment window calculations.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On-device only:</strong> Your data remains on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Data remains until you delete it in the App or uninstall the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>
    Credit Window may offer optional auto-renewable subscriptions via Apple’s In-App Purchase system.
    Payments and subscription management are handled by Apple. We do not receive your full payment details.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID settings on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    The App may request permission to send local notifications (e.g., payment reminders). Notifications are scheduled and delivered by your device.
    You can enable or disable notifications at any time in your device settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Tracking and Advertising</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> We do not track you across apps and websites.</li>
    <li><strong>No advertising SDKs:</strong> The App does not include advertising SDKs.</li>
    <li><strong>No analytics SDKs:</strong> The App does not use third-party analytics tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Credit Window does not share your data with third parties. The App does not integrate third-party services that collect personal data from your use of the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to protect your information by keeping it on-device. However, no method of storage is 100% secure.
    You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and Apple ID.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can view, edit, and delete card information within the App at any time.</li>
    <li>You can disable notifications in system settings.</li>
    <li>You can uninstall the App to remove locally stored data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Credit Window is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>International Users</h2>
  <p>
    The App operates on-device and does not transmit personal data to servers. If you use the App outside your country of residence, the same on-device handling applies.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
  </p>
